	abstract = {Cooling a physical system through a phase transition typically makes it less symmetrical. If the cooling is done very slowly, this symmetry change is uniform throughout the system. For a faster cooling process, the system breaks up into domains: The faster the cooling, the smaller the domains. Navon et al. studied this process in an ultracold gas of Rb atoms near its transition to a condensed state (see the Perspective by Ferrari). The authors found that the size of the domains froze in time in the vicinity of the transition and that it depended on the cooling speed, as predicted by theory.Science, this issue p. 167; see also p. 127 Kibble-Zurek theory models the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which plays an important role in a wide variety of physical contexts, ranging from cosmology to superconductors. We explored these dynamics in a homogeneous system by thermally quenching an atomic gas with short-range interactions through the Bose-Einstein phase transition. Using homodyne matter-wave interferometry to measure first-order correlation functions, we verified the central quantitative prediction of the Kibble-Zurek theory, namely the homogeneous-system power-law scaling of the coherence length with the quench rate. Moreover, we directly confirmed its underlying hypothesis, the freezing of the correlation length near the transition. Our measurements agree with a beyond-mean-field theory and support the expectation that the dynamical critical exponent for this universality class is .},

abstract="The spectral flow of three-body (trimer) states consisting of two heavy (impurity) particles sitting in a condensate of light bosons is considered. Assuming that the condensate is weakly interacting and that an impurity and a boson have a resonant zero-range two-body interaction, we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to determine the effective three-body potential. We solve the resulting Schr{\"o}dinger equation numerically and determine the trimer binding energies as a function of the coherence length of the light bosonic condensate particles. The binding energy is found to be suppressed by the presence of the condensate when the energy scale corresponding to the coherence length becomes of order the trimer binding energy in the absence of the condensate. We find that the Efimov scaling property is reflected in the critical values of the condensate coherence length at which the trimers are pushed into the continuum.",

  abstract={We consider the problem of two heavy impurity particles embedded in a gas of weakly interacting light mass bosonic particles in the condensed state. Using the Bogoliubov approach to describe the bosonic gas and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the three-body dynamics, we calculate the modification to the heavy-heavy two-body potential due to the presence of the condensate. For the case of resonant interaction between the light bosons and the impurities, we present (semi)-analytical results for the potential in the limit of a large condensate coherence length. In particular, we find a formula for the modification of the Efimov scaling factor due to the presence of a degenerate bosonic gas background.}

The space correlation function of the impurity is evaluated with the help of the imaginary-time path integral approach. Employing Feynman's variational method, we calculate the impurity correlation function as well as the energy of the system associated with the impurity. The effect of self-localization predicted before within the Gross{\^a}Pitaevskii approach is recovered by our treatment. The strong coupling regime with negative ground state energy is reached by the variational method, and the corresponding correlation function is calculated.},

Our result is T E = 160{\^A}$\pm$3.5 MeV and {\^I}{\OE} E = 725{\^A}$\pm$35 MeV. For the critical temperature at {\^I}{\OE} = 0 we obtained T c = 172{\^A}$\pm$3 MeV.},

@article{Vlietinck2015,
	Abstract = {We consider two large polaron systems that are described by a Fr{\~A}¶hlich type of Hamiltonian, namely the Bose{\^a}Einstein condensate (BEC) polaron in the continuum and the acoustic polaron in a solid. We present ground-state energies of these two systems calculated with the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method and with a Feynman all-coupling approach. The DiagMC method evaluates up to very high order a diagrammatic series for the polaron{\^a}s self-energy. The Feynman all-coupling approach is a variational method that has been used for a wide range of polaronic problems. For the acoustic and BEC polaron both methods provide remarkably similar non-renormalized ground-state energies that are obtained after introducing a finite momentum cutoff. For the renormalized ground-state energies of the BEC polaron, there are relatively large discrepancies between the DiagMC and the Feynman predictions. These differences can be attributed to the renormalization procedure for the contact interaction.},

In particular we find numerical evidence that the chosen Hamiltonian for the acoustic polaron describes a phase transition from a localized state to an unlocalized state for the electron as the phonon-electron coupling constant decreases. The phase transition manifests itself with a jump discontinuity in the potential energy as a function of the coupling constant. In the weak coupling regime the electron is in an extended state whereas in the strong coupling regime it is found in a self-trapped state.},

	Abstract = {The concept of boson realization (or mapping) of Lie algebras appeared first in nuclear physics in 1962 as the idea of expanding bilinear forms in fermion creation and annihilation operators in Taylor series of boson operators, with the object of converting the study of nuclear vibrational motion into a problem of coupled oscillators. The physical situations of interest are quite diverse, depending, for instance, on whether excitations for fixed- or variable-particle number are being studied, on how total angular momentum is decomposed into orbital and spin parts, and on whether isotopic spin and other intrinsic degrees of freedom enter. As a consequence, all of the semisimple algebras other than the exceptional ones have proved to be of interest at one time or another, and all are studied in this review. Though the salient historical facts are presented in the introduction, in the body of the review the progression is (generally) from the simplest algebras to the more complex ones. With a sufficiently broad view of the physics requirements, the mathematical problem is the realization of an arbitrary representation of a Lie algebra in a subspace of a suitably chosen Hilbert space of bosons (Heisenberg-Weyl algebra). Indeed, if one includes the study of odd nuclei, one is forced to consider the mappings to spaces that are direct-product spaces of bosons and (quasi)fermions. Though all the methods that have been used for these problems are reviewed, emphasis is placed on a relatively new algebraic method that has emerged over the past decade. Many of the classic results are rederived, and some new results are obtained for odd systems. The major application of these ideas is to the derivation, starting from the shell model, of the phenomenological models of nuclear collective motion, in particular, the geometric model of Bohr and Mottelson and the more recently developed interacting boson model of Arima and Iachello. A critical discussion of those applications is interwoven with the theoretical developments on which they are based; many other applications are included, some of practical interest, some simply to illustrate the concepts, and some to suggest new lines of inquiry.},

	Abstract = {Spectral properties of the Hamiltonian function which characterizes a trapped ion are investigated. In order to study semiclassical dynamics of trapped ions, coherent state orbits are introduced as sub-manifolds of the quantum state space, with the K$\backslash$"ahler structure induced by the transition probability. The time dependent variational principle (TDVP) is applied on coherent states' orbits. The Hamilton equations of motion on K$\backslash$"ahler manifolds of the type of classical phase spaces naturally arise. The associated classical Hamiltonian is obtained from the expected values on symplectic coherent states of the quantum Hamiltonian. Spectral information is thus coded within the phase portrait. We deal with the bosonic realization of the Lie algebra of the SU(1,1) group, which we particularize for the case of an ion confined in a combined, Paul and Penning trap. This formalism can be applied to Hamiltonians which are nonlinear in the infinitesimal generators of a dynamical symmetry group, such as the case of ions confined in electrodynamic traps. Discrete quasienergy spectra are obtained and the corresponding quasienergy states are explicitly realized as coherent states parameterized by the stable solutions of the corresponding classical equations of motion. A correspondence between quantum and classical stability domains is thus established, using the Husimi representation.},

@article{Vlietinck2013,
	Abstract = {We report on a study of a spin-down impurity strongly coupled to a spin-up Fermi sea (a so-called Fermi polaron) with the diagrammatic Monte-Carlo (DiagMC) technique. Conditions of zero temperature and three dimensions are considered for an ultracold atomic gas with resonant interactions in the zero-range limit. A Feynman diagrammatic series is developed for the one-body and two-body propagators providing information about the polaron and molecule channel respectively. The DiagMC technique allows us to reach diagram orders that are high enough for extrapolation to infinite order. The robustness of the extracted results is examined by checking various resummation techniques and by running the simulations with various choices for the propagators and vertex functions. It turns out that dressing the lines in the diagrams as much as possible is not always the optimal choice. We also identify classes of dominant diagrams for the one-body and two-body self-energy in the region of strong interaction. These dominant diagrams turn out to be the leading processes of the strong-coupling limit. The quasiparticle energies and \$Z\$-factor are obtained as a function of the interaction strength. We find that the DiagMC results for the molecule and polaron properties are very similar to those obtained with a variational ansatz. Surprisingly, this variational ansatz gives very good predictions for the quasiparticle residue even when this residue is significantly smaller than one.},

	Abstract = {Seventy five years ago, three remarkable papers by Schr¨ odinger, Kennard and Darwin were published. They were devoted to the evolution of Gaussian wave packets for an oscillator, a free particle and a particle moving in uniform constant electric and magnetic fields. From the contemporary point of view, these packets can be considered as prototypes of the coherent and squeezed states, which are, in a sense, the cornerstones of modern quantum optics. Moreover, these states are frequently used in many other areas, from solid state physics to cosmology. This paper gives a review of studies performed in the field of so-called `nonclassical states' (squeezed states are their simplest representatives) over the past seventy five years, both in quantum optics and in other branches of quantum physics. My starting point is to elucidate who introduced different concepts, notions and terms, when, and what were the initial motivations of the authors. Many new references have been found which enlarge the `standard citation package' used by some authors, recovering many undeservedly forgotten (or unnoticed) papers and names. Since it is practically impossible to cite several thousand publications, I have tried to include mainly references to papers introducing new types of quantum states and studying their properties, omitting many publications devoted to applications and to the methods of generation and experimental schemes, which can be found in other well known reviews. I also mainly concentrate on the initial period, which terminated approximately at the border between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, when several fundamental experiments on the generation of squeezed states were performed and the first conferences devoted to squeezed and `nonclassical' states commenced. The 1990s are described in a more `squeezed' manner: I have confined myself to references to papers where some new concepts have been introduced, and to the most recent reviews or papers with extensive bibliographical lists.},

Squeezed states of phonons allow a reduction in the quantum fluctuations of the atomic displacements to below the zero-point quantum noise level of coherent phonon states. Here we discuss our studies of both continuous-wave and impulsive second-order Raman scattering mechanisms. The later approach was used to experimentally suppress (by one part in a million only, which might be noise) fluctuations in phonons (and it has not been clearly reproduced by other experimental groups). We calculate the expectation values and fluctuations of both the atomic displacement and the lattice amplitude operators, as well as the effects of the phonon squeezed states on macroscopically measurable quantities, such as changes in the dielectric constant.

	Abstract = {We develop a systematic variational coherent state expansion for the many-body ground state of the spin-boson model, in which a quantum two-level system is coupled to a continuum of harmonic oscillators. Energetic constraints at the heart of this technique are rationalized in terms of polarons (displacements of the bath states in agreement with classical expectations) and antipolarons (counter-displacements due to quantum tunneling effects). We present a comprehensive study of the ground state two-level system population and coherence as a function of tunneling amplitude, dissipation strength, and bias (akin to asymmetry of the double well potential defining the two-state system). The entanglement among the different environmental modes is investigated by looking at spectroscopic signatures of the bipartite entanglement entropy between a given environmental mode and all the other modes. We observe a drastic change in behavior of this entropy for increasing dissipation, indicative of the entangled nature of the environmental states. In addition, the entropy spreads over a large energy range at strong dissipation, a testimony to the wide entanglement window characterizing the underlying Kondo state. Finally, comparisons to accurate numerical renormalization group calculations and to the exact Bethe Ansatz solution of the model demonstrate the rapid convergence of our variationally-optimized multi-polaron expansion, suggesting that it should also be a useful tool for dissipative models of greater complexity, as relevant for numerous systems of interest in quantum physics and chemistry.},

	Abstract = {We consider a polaronic model in which impurity fermions interact with background bosons in a dipolar condensate. The polaron in this model emerges as an impurity dressed with a cloud of phonons of the dipolar condensate, which, due to the competition between the attractive and repulsive part of the dipole-dipole interaction, obey an anisotropic dispersion spectrum. We study how this anisotropy affects the Cerenkov-like emission of Bogoliubov phonon modes, which can be directly verified by experiments in which a dipolar BEC moves against an obstacle. We also study the spectral function of impurity fermions, which is directly accessible to the momentum resolved rf spectroscopy in cold atoms.},

	Abstract = {Dissipation analogous to spontaneous emission is introduced to a strongly interacting ultracold bosonic gas in the Mott-insulator regime of a 3D spin-dependent optical lattice. A weakly interacting superfluid comprised of atoms in a state that does not experience the lattice potential acts as a dissipative bath coupled via collisions. Bath-induced decay of lattice atoms excited to higher energy bands via Bragg transitions is measured using the atomic quasimomentum distribution. A competing but slower intrinsic decay mechanism arising from collisions between lattice atoms is also investigated. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between the measured bath-induced decay rate and the predictions of a weakly interacting model with no free parameters. The presence of intrinsic decay, which cannot be accommodated within this framework, signals that strong interactions play a central role in the lattice-atom dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Improved control of the motional and internal quantum states of ultracold neutral atoms and ions has opened intriguing possibilities for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Many-body effects have been explored with hundreds of thousands of quantum-degenerate neutral atoms, and coherent light-matter interfaces have been built. Systems of single or a few trapped ions have been used to demonstrate universal quantum computing algorithms and to search for variations of fundamental constants in precision atomic clocks. Until now, atomic quantum gases and single trapped ions have been treated separately in experiments. Here we investigate whether they can be advantageously combined into one hybrid system, by exploring the immersion of a single trapped ion into a Bose-Einstein condensate of neutral atoms. We demonstrate independent control over the two components of the hybrid system, study the fundamental interaction processes and observe sympathetic cooling of the single ion by the condensate. Our experiment calls for further research into the possibility of using this technique for the continuous cooling of quantum computers. We also anticipate that it will lead to explorations of entanglement in hybrid quantum systems and to fundamental studies of the decoherence of a single, locally controlled impurity particle coupled to a quantum environment.},

In a suitable range of parameters, the mixture can be described within a Bogoliubov approach in the presence of fermionic (dynamic) impurities and an effective description in terms of polarons applies. In the dilute limit of the slow impurity regime, the hopping of fermionic particles is exponentially renormalized due to polaron formation, regardless of the sign of the Bose-Fermi interaction. This should lead to clear experimental signatures of polaronic effects, once the regime of interest is reached. The validity of our approach is analyzed in the light of currently available experiments. We provide results for the hopping renormalization factor for different values of temperature, density and Bose-Fermi interaction for three-dimensional \$\^{}\{87\}\backslash rm\{Rb\}-\^{}\{40\}\backslash rm\{K\}\$ mixtures in optical lattice.},

In an attractive Bose-Fermi mixture we observe a significant reduction of the fermionic tunneling energy, which depends on the relative atom numbers. We attribute this to an interaction-induced increase of the lattice depth due to self-trapping of the atoms.},

	Abstract = {We use a class of variational wave functions to study the properties of an impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate, i.e. the "Bose polaron". The impurity interacts with the condensate through a contact interaction, which can be tuned by a Feshbach resonance. We find a stable attractive polaron branch that evolves continuously across the resonance to a tight-binding diatomic molecule deep in the positive scattering length side. A repulsive polaron branch with finite lifetime is also observed and it becomes unstable as the interaction strength increases. The effective mass of the attractive polaron also changes smoothly across the resonance connecting the two well-understood limits deep on both sides.},

	Abstract = {The CuO2 planes in the high-temperature superconductors are described by a two-dimensional Hubbard model. The model is investigated for an infinite system with one and two electrons less than half filling. The method used is to diagonalize the Hamiltonian exactly within a retained portion of the Hilbert space. A single hole is found not to be localized by a string potential that increases linearly with distance, although it does have a large effective mass. A pair of holes, which naively should be quite mobile, is found instead to be extremely heavy due to a previously unappreciated frustration effect that impedes their motion. This lack of mobility increases the energy of the pair so that they do not bind, contrary to some recently published results using mean field theory or intuitive arguments. The energy of one- and two-hole states is calculated as a function of wavevector k. The comparative energy of different angular momentum channels and magnetic polaron effects are discussed.},

	Abstract = {New experimental and theoretical results on the electronic structure and spectral properties of quasiparticles in copper oxides are reviewed. It is shown that the electronic structure transforms from antiferromagnetic insulators to optimally doped high-temperature superconductors as the doping level is varied. The experimental methods considered are primarily angular resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), neutron scattering, and NMR. Two types of electronic structure calculations for data interpretation purposes are considered, namely, exact numerical methods for finite clusters (exact diagonalization and the quantum Monte Carlo method) and approximate schemes for an infinite lattice. As a result, a coherent unified picture emerges, in which magnetic polarons (which are carriers in a weakly doped antiferromagnetic lattice) transform into a system of Fermi quasiparticles dressed in short-range antiferromagnetic-type spin fluctuations. In the region of weakly doped metallic compositions, deviations from Fermi-liquid properties are seen, such as the failure of Luttinger's theorem, shadowy photoemission bands, and the spin pseudogap effect in spectral and thermodynamic measurements. The situation in the neighborhood of the insulator?metal concentration transition is noted to be least understood.},

	Abstract = {Quantum phase transitions arise in many-body systems because of competing interactions that promote rivaling ground states. Recent years have seen the identification of continuous quantum phase transitions, or quantum critical points, in a host of antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion compounds. Studies of the interplay between the various effects have revealed new classes of quantum critical points and are uncovering a plethora of new quantum phases. At the same time, quantum criticality has provided fresh insights into the electronic, magnetic, and superconducting properties of the heavy-fermion metals. We review these developments, discuss the open issues, and outline some directions for future research.},

Fermions interacting with gravity in the Newtonian limit are described by the model of Dirac fermions with the Coulomb attraction. This model also appears in certain condensed matter systems with emergent Dirac fermions interacting via optical phonons. In this model, the classical soliton solutions of equations of motion describe the physical objects that may be called polarons, in analogy to the solutions of the Choquard equation. We develop analytical methods for the Dirac--Coulomb system, showing that the no-node gap solitons for sufficiently small values of charge are linearly (spectrally) stable.},

The corrections to the spectrum due to stronger interactions were first considered by Beliaev (S. T. Beliaev, Sov. Phys.-JETP, 7:289, (1958)). We revisit Beliaev's theory and consider its application to a dilute gas with van der Waals interactions, where the scattering length may be tuned via a Fano-Feshbach resonance. We numerically evaluate Beliaev's expression for the excitation spectrum in the intermediate momentum regime, and we also examine the consequences of the momentum dependence of the two-body scattering amplitude.These results are relevant to the interpretation of a recent Bragg spectroscopy experiment of a strongly interacting Bose gas.},

The result is that, for a given dynamical group, the coherent states are isomorphic to a coset space of group geometrical space. Thus the topological and algebraic structure of the coherent states as well as the associated dynamical system can be extensively discussed. In addition, a quantum-mechanical phase-space representation is constructed via the coherent-state theory. Several useful methods for employing the coherent states to study the physical phenomena of quantum-dynamic systems, such as the path integral, variational principle, classical limit, and thermodynamic limit of quantum mechanics, are described.},

Furthermore we prove that if it is non-degenerate, a Bogoliubov transformation matrix can be decomposed into three basic matrix, by which we can not only check the criterion of the minimum uncertainty state (MUS) found by Milburn, but also prove that except the special cases, any multimode squeezed state is MUS after the original creation and annihilation operators rotate properly. We also discuss some special cases of the three basic matrices. Finally we give an analytical results of a two-mode system as an example.},

We solve numerically Landau-Lifshitz type equations on a lattice and show that in the phase diagram of magnetization and interaction anisotropy, one can identify several distinct regimes of dynamics. These regions can be distinguished based on the character of one dimensional solitonic excitations, and stability of such solitons to transverse modulation. Small amplitude and long wavelength perturbations can be analyzed analytically using mapping of non-linear hydrodynamic equations to KdV type equations. Numerically we find that properties of solitons and dynamics in general remain similar to our analytical results even for large amplitude and short distance inhomogeneities, which allows us to obtain a universal dynamical phase diagram. As a concrete example we study dynamical evolution of the system starting from a state with magnetization step and show that formation of oscillatory regions and their stability to transverse modulation can be understood from the properties of solitons. In regimes unstable to transverse modulation we observe formation of lump type solutions with modulation in all directions. We discuss implications of our results for experiments with ultracold atoms.},
